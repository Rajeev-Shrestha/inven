you can do all the above mentioned functionalities by creating proper tables in database. i.e.,

create one table to store count of wrong attempts, increment count when wrong attempt occurs based on 
the primary key i.e user name, within 5 attempts if he logs successfully then try to make that count to null

While locking the user after 5 unsuccessful attempts store the time and write one script to check that
time continuously, when it meets 30mins call unlock method

For password also take day count, i.e., from changed date, each time when user logs in after checking user 
validity check for password day count if it cross 3days prompt them to change

If you are taking user name as primary key, create one more table to store max 10 passwords for each user, 
while inserting password to this table(when user changes his password),check the table for number rows for 
that user if it is 10 then based on the last lesser date you can delete that row and insert new password 
and you can compare new password with old passwords also while inserting.
